# Work Journal

This is a command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Python to help visualize sequentially text files where I keep my work journals. They contain the goals for the day and which of them were executed. For the executed ones, I often include a description of what I did. 
Importantly, there are also functionalities to keep track of the time spent on different task categories. It is possible to see the total amount of hours worked per day, per week or per month.
