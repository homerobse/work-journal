This is a command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Python to help visualize sequentially text files where I keep my work journals. They contain the goals for the day and which of them were executed. For the executed ones, I often include a description of what I did. 
Furthermore, there are also functionalities to keep track of the time spent on  different task categories.
