## Grace Federal University policy - 3/29/2022 whatsapp
"Podia dividir 30 dias em 3x, 2x ou 1x
Vc podia dividir assim: 5 dias, 10 dias e 15 dias."
No caso de 5 dias, não contaria o fim de semana.

"A pessoa podia escolher qualquer dia pra iniciar
O importante é completar os 30 dias"

## Fabricio Alves Borges (Barui) policy at Schneider Electric - jan/2025

25 workdays-hours, later increased to 30 workday-hours. That means one can take, for example, one hour of vacation, if they want to. The total would be 25*8, or 30*8 total hours per year.
